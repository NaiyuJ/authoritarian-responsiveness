# authoritarian-legislator-responsiveness code

This repository contains code for the paper Legislator Responsiveness in China’s National People’s Congress by Naiyu Jiang. These python scripts have been written to find cosine similarity between any two text documents using word2vec.

## 1. Train Word Vectors：Word2vec

I use Word2vec to train word vectors. Word2vec is a method to efficiently create word embeddings, which are vector representations of a particular word. The word2vec algorithms include skip-gram and CBOW models, using either hierarchical softmax or negative sampling. For details on word2vec, see [this link](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/).
